## This is an ANN model to classify the 46 class devanagri dataset available at kaggle

### 1. The model here is simple ANN with 2 Dense layers with Relu and Softmax as activations respectively. The 1st dense layer contains 130 neurons while the 2nd dense layer or the output layer contains 46 neurons (no of classes). The provision of dropout is given and the sparse_categorical_crossentropy is used as loss.
### 2. The loss and accuracy has been plotted with respective titles and axes names.
